# Exploring Python's Turtle graphics library

## **_Question 1_: Which package/library did you select?**
- I chose to use the **Turtle Graphics Library** in python for the exploration activity.

## **_Question 2:_ What is the package/library?**
- _What purpose does it serve?_ : The Turtle graphics library in Python serves multiple valuable purposes. Primarily, it acts as an **educational tool**, providing an interactive and visually engaging way to teach programming concepts, especially to beginners. It is also a practical choice for **creating graphics, art, and simple animations**, making it accessible to programmers of all skill levels. Finally, it encourages **creative exploration and experimentation**, allowing programmers to invent their own drawing algorithms and artistic creations.

- _How do you use it?_ : ### 1.Basic Setup 
To actually use Turtle graphics, you'll need to import the `turtle` module like so:
```python
import turtle
```

### 2.Creating a turtle
Now, to create a turtle object, you must use the 'Turtle' class:
```python
my_turtle = turtle.Turtle()
```
You can now customize the turtle's shape and/or speed using methods from the turtle class:
```python
my_turtle.shape('turtle')  # Set the turtle's shape to a turtle icon
my_turtle.speed(1)         # Set the turtle's drawing speed (1 is slowest, 10 is fastest)
```
